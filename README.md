# What is it?
These scripts were used to build a 2D game called Glitch Garden. I'm using them in conjunction with Unity 3D.

Glitch Garden is a Defender game, that was abandoned. The game art and code is in the public domain and available [here](https://www.glitchthegame.com/public-domain-game-art/). 

I built that game as part of a Udemy course called [Learn to Code by Making Games](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/).

# How to Use
Add a script you want to use as a component on a Unity GameObject. Drag and drop any required missing element for the script in the Inspector in Unity.

Read the comments in the code to understand what the script does. In most cases, the name of the script will give you a good hint at what it does.

Most of the scripts have to do with the behavior of attackers or defenders in a 2D world.

# Supported SW / Compatibility
The scripts work with Unity 5.4. This is what I'm using to build the game.

If you want to use them for earlier version of Unity (in particular with Unity 4), you'll have to change the syntax of some commands.
